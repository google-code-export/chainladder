=== ChainLadder: R package for insurance claims reserving ===

Version 0.1.2-13
===============
USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o 'MackChainLadder' has new argument 'alpha' and 'weights' has a different meaning.
    alpha describes differnt chain ladder age-to-age factors.  
   
   - The default for all alphas is 1. 
     See Mack's 1999 paper; alpha=1 gives the historical chain ladder age-to-age factors, 
     alpha=0 gives the straight average of the observed individual development factors and 
     alpha=2 is the result of an ordinary regression with intercept 0 
   - Weights are now just that, weights in [0;1]

BUG FIXES

  o 'MackChainLadder':  Latest position of incomplete triangles were not returned correctly. 
    Thanks to Ben Escoto for reporting and providing a patch.

  o 'MackChainLadder': Mack.S.E for non-standard chain ladder factors (e.g. straight averages or 
    ordinary regression through the origin) where not correctly calculated due to a missing argument 
    for alpha. See also Mack's 1999 paper. Many thanks to Przemyslaw Sloma for reporting this bug. 

Version 0.1.2.12
================

NEW FEATURES

 o New triangle class with S3 methods for plot, print and conversion from triangles to data.frames and vis versa
 o New utility functions 'incr2cum' and 'cum2incr' to convert incremental triangles into cumulative triangles
 and vis versa. Thanks to Chritophe Dutang.
 o New logical argument lattice for plot.MackChainLadder (and plot.triangle), which allows to plot developments 
   by origin period in separate panels.  

BUG FIXES

  o 'MunichChainLadder': tail factors were not accepted. Thanks to Stefan Pohl for reporting this issue.

Version 0.1.2-11
===============
BUG FIXES

  o 'MackChainLadder': 'F.se'[ultimate] was calculated of the ultimate column instead of the latest paid. 

Version 0.1.2-10
===============
USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o 'MackChainLadder' has new arguments 'tail.sigma' and 'tail.se' to provide estimates for 
    the variability of for a given tail factor
 
BUG FIXES

  o 'MackChainLadder': calculation of 'Mack.S.E' did not use an ultimate sigma factor to estimate 
    'Mack.S.E' when a tail factor > 1 was provided (Thanks to Mark Hoffmann for reporting this issue).

Version 0.1.2-9
===============
USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Updated documentation to work with new Rd-file parser (R version >= 2.9.0)
  o Updated documentation for 'ABC' data (Thanks to Glen Barnett)

Version 0.1.2-8
===============
USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Updated documentation for 'MackChainLadder' (Thanks to Daniel Murphy)

Version 0.1.2-7
===============
USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
  
  o 'MackChainLadder' gives two more elements back: 'Mack.ProcessRisk' and 'Mack.ParameterRisk' 
    for the process and parameter risk error (Thanks to Daniel Murphy)
  o In the summary output of 'MackChainLadder' the label 'CV'  changed to 'CV(IBNR)' to clarify 
    that we show the coefficient of variance of the IBNR.
  o 'MackChainLadder' provides new example plots for CV(IBNR) vs. origin period and CV(Ultimate) vs. origin period  
  o Updated documentation

Version 0.1.2-6
===============
USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Updated documentation

Version 0.1.2-5
===============

NEW FEATURES

  o New function 'BootChainLadder', based on papers by England and Verrall, 
    and Barnett and Zehnwirth
 
  o 'MackChainLadder' and 'MunichChainLadder' allow for tail factors

  o 'MackChainLadder' estimates the overall standard error for the total IBNR
		
  o New arguments 'tail' and 'est.sigma' for MackChainLadder, to control 
    the tail factor and the estimation of sigma_{n-1}

  o New arguments 'tailP', 'tailI' and 'est.sigmaP', 'est.sigmaI' for
    'MunichChainLadder', which are passed on to 'MackChainLadder' to control 
    the tail factor and the estimation of sigma_{n-1} for the Paid and 
    Incurred triangle

  o 'Mack-, 'Munich-, and 'BootChainLadder' accept (mxn) matrices with m>=n,
    e.g more accident years than development years

  o New example data sets: 'ABC' (annual run-off triangle of a worker's 
    compensation portfolio of a large company), 'qpaid', 'qincurred' ('made-up'
    data of a quarterly development triangle of annual origin period)
	
  o Triangles with higher development period frequency (e.g quarterly) than 
    origin period frequency (e.g annual) can be used after being 'blown-up'
    to a common period frequency, see the help of 'qpaid'

  o 'Mack-, 'Munich- and 'BootChainLadder' accept 'blown-up' triangles of 
    higher development period frequency than origin period frequency filled 
    with 'NA', see the help of 'qpaid'

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o summary functions for 'Mack-, 'Munich-, 'BootChainLadder' give all a list 
    back with two elements: 'ByOrigin' and 'Totals'	
 
  o Change of labels: origin years -> origin period and development years ->
    development origin

  o Coefficient of Variance is abbreviate with 'CV' instead of 'CoV'

  o The example spreadsheet 'ChainLadder_in_Excel.xls' has new examples, 
    including 'BootChainLadder'

  o New greeting message after the R-call 'library(ChainLadder)'

  o Improved documentation

BUG FIXES

  o 'MunichChainLadder': calculation of 'lambdaP' and 'lambdI' was incorrect. 
    Thanks to Beat Huggler for reporting this issue.
