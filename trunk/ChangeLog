	* R/MackChainLadderFunctions.R: added function
	TotalMack.S.E function to estimate the overall standard error for
	the reserve. MackChainLadder gives now also the
	Total.Mack.S.E. back plus the estimate standard error for all
	individual age-to-age factors F.se.

	* R/MackChainLadderFunctions.R: Mack.S.E checks now which sigma>0 before log
	linear regression of sigma to estimate sigma[n-1]

	* inst/Excel/ChainLadder_in_Excel.xls uses now dynamic functions 
	and shows how to call 'plot' from Excel 
	* R/MackChainLadderFunctions.R: Changed labels Reserving to IBNR 
	(=Incurred But Not Reported)

         * R/MackChainLadder.R Bug fix: Function Mack.S.E did not give F.se back, 
           which is needed by TotalMack.S.E. 
           Many thanks to Florian Leitenstorfer for reporting this issue.

         * R/MackChainLadder.R Prepared the functions Mack.S.E and 
	   Total.Mack.S.E to accept triangles with rows full of NA values.
	   This might be useful for non quadratic triangles

	* R/MackChainLadder.R Included tail factor estimation. The
	function MackChainLadder has a new argument "tail" to either
	estimate the tail factor via a log-linear regression or to set it manually.
	* data/qpaid.RData, qincurred.RData Added examples of quarterly
	development triangles

	* R/BootstrapReserve.R Included all the functions for the BootChainLadder
	function. The BootChainLadder procedure	provides a predictive
	distribution of reserves for a cumulative claims development
	triangle.
	* R/BootstrapReserve.R, MackChainLadder.R, MunichChainLadder The summary
	methods for MackChainLadder, MunichChainLadder, BootChainLadder
	give a list back with two elements "ByOrigin" and "Totals"
	* R/zzz.R Included a .onLoad function to produce a little meassage
	after the ChainLadder packge is loaded.
	* Excel/ChainLadder_in_Excel.xls Added new examples for
	BootChainLadder and how to use Rapply to call functions from the
	ChainLadder package.

	* The ChangeLog is now part of version control system on the
	project web-site under Google code.
