\title{Munich-Chain-Ladder Model }
\description{
  The Munich-Chain-Ladder model forecasts IBNR claims based on a cumulative
  paid and incurred claims triangle. 
  The Munich-Chain-Ladder model assumes that the Mack-model is applicable
  to the paid and incurred claims triangle, see \code{\link{MackChainLadder}}.
}
\usage{
MunichChainLadder(Paid, Incurred, 
                  est.sigmaP = "loglinear", est.sigmaI = "loglinear", 
                  tailP=FALSE, tailI=FALSE)
