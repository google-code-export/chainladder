## MackChainLadder expects a quadratic matrix so let's expand 
## the triangle to a quarterly origin period.
n <- ncol(qpaid)
Paid <- matrix(NA, n, n)
Paid[seq(1,n,4),] <- qpaid
M <- MackChainLadder(Paid)
plot(M)

# We expand the incurred triangle in the same way 
Incurred <- matrix(NA, n, n)
Incurred[seq(1,n,4),] <- qincurred

# With the expanded triangles we can apply MunichChainLadder
MunichChainLadder(Paid, Incurred)

# In the same way we can apply BootChainLadder
# We reduce the size of bootstrap replicates R from the default of 999 to 99 purely to reduce run time.
