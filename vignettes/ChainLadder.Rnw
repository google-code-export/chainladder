\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Claims reserving in insurance}
Unlike other industries the insurance industry does not sell products
as such, but promises. An insurance policy is a promise by the insurer
to the policyholder to pay for future claims for an upfront received
premium. 

As a result insurers don't know the upfront cost of their
service, but rely on historical data analysis and judgement to derive a
sustainable price for their offering. In General Insurance (or Non-Life
Insurance, e.g. motor, property and casualty insurance) most policies
run for a period of 12 months. However, the claims payment process 
can take years or even decades. Therefore often not even the delivery
date of their product is known to insurers. 

In particular claims arising from casualty insurance can take a long
time to settle. Claims can take years to materialise. A complex and
costly example are the claims from asbestos liabilities. 
A research report by a  working party of the  Institute of Actuaries
has estimated that the undiscounted cost of UK mesothelioma-related
claims to the UK Insurance Market for the period 2009 to 2050 could be
around $\pounds$10bn~\cite{Gravelsons2009}. The cost for aAsbestos
related claims in the US for the worldwide insurance industry was
estimate to be around \$120bn in 2002~\cite{Michaels2002}.  

Thus, it should come to no surprise that the biggest item on the
liability side of an insurer's balance sheet is often the provision or
reserves for future claims payments. Those reserves can be broken
down in case reserves (or out-standings claims), which are losses
already reported to the insurance company and incurred but not
reported (IBNR) claims.

Over the years several methods have been developed to estimate
reserves for insurance claims, see~\cite{Schmidt2011},
\cite{EnglandVerrall2002} for an overview. Changes in regulatory
requirements, e.g. Solvency II\footnote{See
  \url{http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/insurance/solvency/index_en.htm}}
in Europe, have fostered further research into this topic, with a
focus on stochastic and statistical techniques.   

\section{The \chainladder package}

\subsection{Motivation}
The \chainladder~\cite{chainladder} package provides various
statistical methods which are typically used for the estimation of
outstanding claims reserves in general insurance.  The package started
out of presentations given by Markus Gesmann at the Stochastic
Reserving Seminar at the Institute of Actuaries in 2007 and 2008,
followed by talks at Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS)  meetings joined
by Dan Murphy in 2008 and Wayne Zhang in 2010.  

 Implementing reserving methods in R has several advantages. R provides:

 \begin{itemize}

 \item a rich language for statistical modelling and data manipulations
   allowing fast prototyping  
  
 \item a very active user base, which publishes many extension

 \item many interfaces to data bases and other applications, such as MS
   Excel
  
 \item an established framework for documentation and testing 

 \item workflows with version control systems

 \item code written in plain text files, allowing effective knowledge
   transfer 

 \item an effective way to collaborate over the internet

 \item built in functions to create reproducible research
   reports\footnote{For an example see the project: Formatted Actuarial Vignettes in
     R, \url{http://www.favir.net/}}

 \item in combination with other tools such as  {\LaTeX} and Sweave
   easy to set up automated reporting facilities

 \item access to academic research, which is often first implemented in R  
    
 \end{itemize}


\subsection{Brief package overview}
This vignette will give the reader a brief overview of the functionallity of 
the \chainladder package. The functions are discussed and explained in 
more detail in the respective help files and examples. 
%% The help files contain the references to the research papers on
%% which the methods are based.  

The \chainladder package has implementations of the Mack-, Munich- and 
Boot\-strap chain-ladder methods~\cite{Mack1993}, \cite{Mack1999}, 
\cite{Quarg2004}, \cite{EnglandVerrall1999}. 
Since version 0.1.3-3 it provides general multivariate 
chain ladder models by Wayne Zhang~\cite{Zhang2010a}. 
Version 0.1.4-0 introduced new functions on loss development factor
(LDF) fitting methods and Cape Cod by Daniel Murphy following a paper
by David Clark~\cite{Clark2003}.  Version 0.1.5-0 has added loss
reserving models within the generalized linear model framework
following a paper by England and Verrall~\cite{EnglandVerrall1999}
implemented by Wayne Zhang.  

The package also offers utility functions to convert quickly
tables into triangles, triangles into tables, cumulative into
incremental and incremental into cumulative triangles. 

A set of demos is shipped with the packages and the list of demos
is available via: 
<<eval=FALSE>>=
demo(package="ChainLadder")
@ 
and can be executed via
<<eval=FALSE>>=
library(ChainLadder)
demo("demo name")
@

Additionally the \chainladder package comes with example files which
demonstrates how to the \chainladder functions can be embedded in
Excel and Word using the \href{http://rcom.univie.ac.at/}{statconn}
interface\cite{BaierNeuwirth2007}. 

For more information and examples see the project web site:
\url{http://code.google.com/p/chainladder/}

\subsection{Installation}
We can install \chainladder in the usual way from CRAN, e.g.:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
install.packages('ChainLadder') 
@
For more details about installing packages see~\cite{Radmin}. The
installation was successful if the  command
\texttt{library(ChainLadder)} gives you the following message: 
<<echo=FALSE, quite=TRUE>>=
library(ChainLadder)
@ 
<<eval=FALSE>>=
library(ChainLadder)
@ 
<<echo=FALSE>>=
cat(ChainLadder:::chainladderWelcomeMessage())
@ 

\section{Using the  \chainladder package}

\subsection{Working with triangles}

Historical insurance data is often presented in form of a triangle
structure, showing the development of claims over time for each origin
period. An origin period could be the year the policy was sold, or
the accident year. Of course the frequency doesn't have to be yearly, e.g.
quarterly of monthly origin periods are also often used. Most
reserving methods of the \chainladder package expect triangles as
input data sets with development periods along the columns and the
origin  period in rows. The package comes with several example
triangles.  The following R command will list them all: 
<<eval=FALSE>>=
require(ChainLadder)
data(package="ChainLadder")
@ 

Let's look at one example triangle more closely. The following triangle shows 
data from the Reinsurance Association of America (RAA):
<<>>=
## Sample triangle
RAA
@ 
The objective of a reserving exercise is to forecast the future claims
development in the bottom right corner of the triangle and potential
further developments. Eventually all claims for a given origin period
wil be settled, but it is not always obvious to judge how many years
or even decades it will take. We speak of long and short tail business
depending on the time it takes to pay all claims.

\subsubsection{Plotting triangles}
The first thing you often want to do is to plot the data to get an
overview. For a data set of class \texttt{triangle} the \chainladder package
provides default plotting methods to give a graphical overview of the
data: 
<<eval=FALSE>>=
plot(RAA)
@ 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
<<fig=TRUE, label=TrianglePlot1, echo=FALSE>>=
plot(RAA)
@ 
\caption{Claims development chart of the \texttt{RAA} triangle, with
  one line per origin period. Output of \texttt{plot(RAA)}
  }
\label{RAAplot}
\end{figure}

Setting the argument \texttt{lattice=TRUE} will produce individual
plots for each origin period\footnote{\chainladder uses the
  \href{http://cran.r-project.org/package=lattice}{\texttt{lattice}}
  package for plotting the development of the origin years in separate
panels.}, see Figure~\ref{RAAplot2}. 
<<eval=FALSE>>=
plot(RAA, lattice=TRUE)
@ 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
<<fig=TRUE, label=TrianglePlot2, echo=FALSE>>=
plot(RAA, lattice=TRUE)
@ 
\caption{Claims development chart of the \texttt{RAA} triangle, with
  individual panels for each origin period. Output of
  \texttt{plot(RAA, lattice=TRUE)}
  }
\label{RAAplot2}
\end{figure}

You will notice from the plots in Figures~\ref{RAAplot} and
\ref{RAAplot2}  that the triangle \texttt{RAA} presents claims
developments for  the origin years 1981 to 1990 in a cumulative form.
For more information on the triangle plotting functions see the help
pages of \texttt{plot.triangle}, e.g. via
<<eval=FALSE>>=
?plot.triangle
@ 

\subsubsection{Transforming triangles between cumulative and
  incremental representation}
The \chainladder packages comes with two helper functions,
\texttt{cum2incr} and \texttt{incr2cum} to transform
cumulative triangles into incremental triangles and vice versa:
<<>>=
raa.inc <- cum2incr(RAA)
## Show first origin period and its incremental development
raa.inc[1,]
raa.cum <- incr2cum(raa.inc)
## Show first origin period and its cumulative development
raa.cum[1,]
@ 

\subsubsection{Importing triangles from external data sources}
In most cases you want to analyse your own data, usually stored in
data bases. R makes it easy to access data using SQL statements,
e.g. via an ODBC connection\footnote{See the
  \href{http://cran.r-project.org/package=RODBC}{\texttt{RODBC}}
  package} and the \chainladder packages includes a demo to showcase
how data can be imported from a MS Access data base, see: 
<<eval=FALSE>>=
demo(DatabaseExamples)
@ 
For more details see~\cite{Rdata}.

In this section we use data stored in a CSV-file\footnote{Please
  ensure that your CSV-file is free from formatting, e.g. characters to
  separate units of thousands, as those columns will be read as
  characters or factors rather than numerical values.} to demonstrate some
typical operations you will want to carry out with data stored in data bases.
In most cases your triangles will be stored in tables and not in a
classical triangle shape. The \chainladder package contains a
CSV-file with sample data in a long table format. We read the
data into R's memory with the \texttt{read.csv} command and look at
the first couple of rows and summarise it:

<<>>=
filename <-  file.path(system.file("Database", 
                                   package="ChainLadder"), 
                       "TestData.csv")
myData <- read.csv(filename)
head(myData)
summary(myData)
@ 
Let's focus on one subset of the data. We select the RAA data again:
<<>>=
raa <- subset(myData, lob %in% "RAA")
head(raa)
@ 
To transform the long table of the RAA data into a triangle we use the
function \texttt{as.triangle}. The arguments we have to specify are
the column names of the origin and development period and further the
column which contains the values:
<<>>=
raa.tri <- as.triangle(raa, 
                       origin="origin", 
                       dev="dev", 
                       value="value")
raa.tri
@ 
We note that the data has been stored as an incremental data set. As
mentioned above, we could now use the function \texttt{incr2cum} to
transform the triangle into a cumulative format.

We can transform a triangle back into a data frame structure:
<<>>=
raa.df <- as.data.frame(raa.tri, na.rm=TRUE)
head(raa.df)
@ 
This is particular helpful when you would like to store your results
back into data base. Figure~\ref{fig:database} gives you an idea of a
potential data flow between R and data bases.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{RandDatabases}
  \caption{Flow chart of data between R and data bases.}
  \label{fig:database}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Coping and pasting from MS Excel}
Small data sets in Excel can be transfered to R backwards and forwards
with via the clipboard under MS Windows.
\paragraph{Copying from Excel to R}
Select a data set in Excel and copy it into the clipboard, then go to
R and type:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
x <- read.table(file="clipboard", sep="\t", na.strings="")
@ 
\paragraph{Copying from R to Excel}
Suppose you would like to copy the \texttt{RAA} triangle into Excel,
then the following statement would copy the data into the clipboard:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
write.table(RAA, file="clipboard", sep="\t", na="")
@ 
Now you can paste the content into Excel. Please note that you can't
copy lists structures from R to Excel. 

\subsection{Chain-ladder methods}

The classical chain-ladder is a  deterministic algorithm 
to forecast claims based on historical data. It assumes that the
proportional developments of claims from one development period to the
next are the same for all origin years.

\subsubsection{Basic idea}
The age-to-age link ratios are calculated as the volume weighted
average development ratios of a cumulative loss development triangle
from one development period to the next $C_{ik}, i,k =1, \dots, n$. 
\begin{align}
  f_{k} &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n-k} C_{i,k+1}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n-k}C_{i,k}}
\end{align}
<<>>=
n <- 10
f <- sapply(1:(n-1), 
             function(i){
               sum(RAA[c(1:(n-i)),i+1])/sum(RAA[c(1:(n-i)),i])
             }
             )
f
@

Often it is not suitable to assume that the oldest origin year is
fully developed. A typical approach is to extrapolate the development
ratios, e.g. assuming a log-linear model.
<<fig=TRUE>>=
dev.period <- 1:(n-1)
plot(log(f-1) ~ dev.period, main="Log-linear extrapolation of age-to-age factors")
tail.model <- lm(log(f-1) ~ dev.period) 
abline(tail.model)
co <- coef(tail.model)
## extrapolate another 100 dev. period
tail <- exp(co[1] + c((n + 1):(n + 100)) * co[2]) + 1
f.tail <- prod(tail)
f.tail      
@ 

The age-to-age factors allow us to plot the expected claims development
patterns.
<<fig=TRUE>>=
plot(100*(rev(1/cumprod(rev(c(f, tail[tail>1.0001]))))), t="b",
     main="Expected claims development pattern",
     xlab="Dev. period", ylab="Development % of ultimate loss") 
@ 

The link ratios are then applied to the latest know cumulative
claims amount to forecast the next development period. 
<<>>=
f <- c(f, f.tail)
fullRAA <- RAA
for(k in 1:(n-1)){ 
  fullRAA[(n-k+1):n, k+1] <- fullRAA[(n-k+1):n,k]*f[k]
}
fullRAA[,n] <- fullRAA[,n]*f[n] 
round(fullRAA)
@ 

This approach is also called Loss Development Factor (LDF) method.


Since the early 1990s several papers have been published to embed the
simple chain-ladder method into a statistical framework. Ben Zehnwirth
and Glenn Branett point out in~\cite{ZehnwirthBarnettProceedings} that
the age-to-age link ratios can be regarded as the coefficients of a
weighted linear regression through the origin, see
also~\cite{DanielMurphy1994}. 
<<>>=
lmCL <- function(i, Triangle){
  lm(y~x+0, weights=1/Triangle[,i],
     data=data.frame(x=Triangle[,i], y=Triangle[,i+1]))
} 
sapply(lapply(c(1:(n-1)), lmCL, RAA), coef)
@ 
\subsubsection{Mack chain-ladder}
Thomas Mack published in 1993 ~\cite{Mack_distributionfree1993} an
article which allows to estimate the standard errors of the
chain-ladder forecast without assuming a distribution under certain
constrain to the data.

Following Mack~\cite{Mack1999}  let $C_{ik}$ denote the cumulative loss
amounts of origin period (e.g. accident year) $i=1,\ldots,m$, with
losses known for development period  (e.g. development year) $k \le n+1-i$.

In order to forecast the amounts $C_{ik}$ for $k > n+1-i$ the Mack
chain-ladder-model assumes: 
\begin{align}
  \mbox{CL1: }  & E[ F_{ik}| C_{i1},C_{i2},\ldots,C_{ik} ] = f_k
  \mbox{ with } F_{ik}=\frac{C_{i,k+1}}{C_{ik}}\\
    \mbox{CL2: } &  Var( \frac{C_{i,k+1}}{C_{ik}} | C_{i1},C_{i2},
    \ldots,C_{ik} ) = \frac{\sigma_k^2}{w_{ik} C^\alpha_{ik}}\\
  \mbox{CL3: } & \{C_{i1},\ldots,C_{in}\}, \{
    C_{j1},\ldots,C_{jn}\},\mbox{ are independent for origin period } i
    \neq j 
\end{align}
with $w_{ik} \in [0;1], \alpha \in \{0,1,2\}$.  If these
assumptions are hold, the Mack-chain-ladder-model gives an 
unbiased estimator for IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) claims.

The Mack-chain-ladder model can be regarded as a weighted linear regression
through the origin for each development period:
\verb|lm(y ~ x  + 0, weights=w/x^(2-alpha))|, 
where \texttt{y} is the vector of claims at development period
$k+1$ and \texttt{x} is  the vector of claims at development period
$k$.

\section{Using \chainladder with RExcel and SWord}


The  spreadsheet is located in the Excel folder
of the package. The R command 
<<eval=FALSE>>=
system.file("Excel", package="ChainLadder") 
@ 
will tell you the exact path to the directory. To use the spreadsheet you will need the
RExcel-Add-in~\cite{BaierNeuwirth2007}. The package also provides an
example SWord file,  demonstrating how the functions of the package
can be integrated into a MS Word file via
SWord~\cite{BaierNeuwirth2007}. Again you find the Word file via the
command:  
<<eval=FALSE>>=
system.file("SWord", package="ChainLadder") 
@ 

The package comes with several demos to provide you with an overview
of the package functionality, see
<<eval=FALSE>>=
