\title{Munich-Chain-Ladder Model }
\description{
  Munich-Chain-Ladder model to forecast IBNR claims based on a cumulative
  paid and incurred claims triangle. 
  The Munich-Chain-Ladder model assumes that the Mack-model is applicable
  to the paid and incurred claims triangle, see \code{\link{MackChainLadder}}.
